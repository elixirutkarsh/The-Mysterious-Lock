# The-Mysterious-Lock
You have come across a mysterious lock with a 4-digit code. The following clues will help you determine the code:

The first digit is half the value of the second digit.
The third digit is the sum of the first and second digits.
The fourth digit is three times the value of the third digit.
The sum of all four digits is 18.
What is the 4-digit code for the lock?

Solution:
Let's use variables to represent the digits of the code. Based on the clues given, we can deduce the following equations:

x = 2y
z = x + y
w = 3z
x + y + z + w = 18
Solving these equations, we find:

x = 4
y = 2
z = 6
w = 18

Therefore, the 4-digit code for the lock is 4266.
